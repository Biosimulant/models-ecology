# NIK-dependent p100 processing into p52 with RelB binding and IkBd degradation, mass action, SBML 2v4

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000871)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Simon Mitchell; Alexander Hoffmann

## Description

This model represents NIK-dependent p100 processing into p52 followed by binding to RelB and NIK-dependent IkBd degradation. This model assesses the impact of substrate complex competition on RelB-p52


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
