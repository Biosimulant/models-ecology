# Leibovich2022 - multispecies eco-competition describes by Master equation

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2212080001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Nava Leibovich; Jeremy Rothschild; Sidhartha Goyal; Anton Zilman

## Description

We are using a minimal model of interacting multispecies ecological communities that incorporates competition, immigration, and demographic noise. Importantly, the dynamics of the system are described


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/ecology-sbml-leibovich2022-multispecies-eco-competition-descr-model2212080001-model/model.yaml
