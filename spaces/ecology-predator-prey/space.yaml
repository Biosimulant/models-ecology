scientific_context:
  question: "How do predator and prey populations co-evolve under fixed environmental conditions?"
  mode: "causal"
  assumptions:
    - "Population modules exchange signals using deterministic wiring at a fixed tick."
    - "Predation pressure is represented by a single interaction model and applied to prey mortality."
    - "Environment remains stationary in this baseline scenario (no seasonal forcing)."
  expected_observables:
    - "Oscillatory or damped trajectories in rabbit and fox populations."
    - "Phase-space loops or convergence in rabbits-vs-foxes state space."
    - "Summary metrics for diversity, extinctions, and stability."
  limitations:
    - "Only two species are modeled explicitly."
    - "Abiotic variables are fixed unless parameters are changed."
